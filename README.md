---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Anonymous-SMS.git
cd Anonymous-SMS
# Or just download Anon-sms.py and run it ```

2. Install dependencies
```bash pip install requests ```
3. Run the script
```bash python Anon-sms.py </pre> ```

The script will send the message via the free Textbelt endpoint.

🌐 Textbelt API Notes
This script uses the free Textbelt endpoint (https://textbelt.com/text) with a default key.

The free key is limited to 1 message per day per IP address.

For unlimited use, get a paid key from Textbelt, or wait for me to publish a new free way to send unlimited sms.

To use a custom API key, modify this line in the script:

<pre> ```python 'key': 'textbelt' # Change 'textbelt' to your paid key. ``` </pre>
